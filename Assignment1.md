## Instructions

There are 4 R files. Each one contains the following:

- cullfat function: Which loads the original dataset (household_power_consumption.txt) and saves out the small subset we are using as "data.csv".
- makeTimestamp function which re-writes the "Date" and "Time" columns in data.csv as one column

These two functions only need to be run once so they are commented out in the code.

Then each file contains a "plot function" (plot1, plot2,...), which contrusts the graph and saves it out as a PNG.
